Mudae utility stuff using JS on Google Sheets

Codes based on Okami, LilJamJam and iFailatDiscord's original creation (Kakera Value) and davidebic and Svess's (Wishlist Spawnrate), i simply adapted it to Google Sheets together with Douglas_O.
Credits can also be found on the 'Config./Info' tab on the Spreadsheet.

Original Kakera Tower code by me.
